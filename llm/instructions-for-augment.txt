Here are some things to remember. Always do these:
- Make commits after every conceptual change (don't bundle multiple changes into a single commit)
- Tag all commit messages with "- auggie" to attribute them to the AI assistant
- Use shorter timeouts when waiting for processes to complete
- Source the  .be file before running scripts to have the right keys in the environment
